# Session 18 
## The Eighteenth session of the LSSTC DSFP focuses on Image Processing for Wide Field Surveys

## Day 1 – Introduction to Imaging and Detectors

“It is believed that the results will be an astronomical bible for at least a century to come.”

~ In reference to the Sky Survey by the Schmidt Telescope at Palomar (1949)

## Day 2 – Backgrounds, Astrometry, and Photometry

"I proposed to do this, not in order to gain prestige by refuting others (this would be a paltry and petty thought; on the contrary, I believe that we must be grateful to all those who personally undertake labours for the common interest); but so that neither you nor others who are eager to know may be led astray in observing the phenomena of the cosmos."

~ Hipparchus, about 140-150 BCE
